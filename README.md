# Rays Workday Scheduler

## Description

My goal when working on this project was to help me learn the intricacies of applying dayjs to my javascript.

The Workday Scheduler is a user-friendly calendar application designed to help you organize your workday efficiently. 

Working on this was helpful because it helped me solidify my usage of APIs and loop functions.
